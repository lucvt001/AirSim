# AirSim for both SimpleFlight and PhysXCar

This repository follows the work of [Danieto98](https://github.com/danieto98/AirSim) by fixing most of the bugs when working with Windows. Changes to ROS packages have *not* been made.

## Known limitations
- Only support SimpleFlight and PhysXCar in "Both" mode.
